# Multi-Dimensional Memory Management System

A sophisticated memory management system designed for kernel memory allocation with orthogonal multi-dimensional requirements and intelligent resource optimization.

## Architecture Overview

The system implements a hierarchical memory architecture with three dimensions:
- **Processing Elements (PE)**: Top-level compute units
- **Memory Sub-Systems (MSS)**: Memory controllers within each PE  
- **Slices**: Memory segments within each MSS

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Mapping Forking
The system starts with a universal mapping covering all coordinates and progressively forks into specialized mappings as allocation patterns diverge.

```python
# Starts with one universal mapping
manager = MappingCentricMemoryManager(pe_count=2, mss_per_pe=2, slices_per_mss=8)

# PE-specific allocation triggers forking
pe_specific = MemoryRequirement(
    size=1024,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=0),  # PE 0 only
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),               # All MSS
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),             # All slices
)
```

### 2. Batch Allocation with Requirement Ordering Optimization
The system can collect multiple requirements and allocate them in an optimal order to minimize conflicts and mapping forking:

```python
# Collect requirements for batch processing
manager = MappingCentricMemoryManager(pe_count=2, mss_per_pe=2, slices_per_mss=8)

# Add requirements in any order - system will optimize
manager.collect_requirement(pe_specific_req)      # Would normally cause early forking
manager.collect_requirement(auto_selection_req)   # Auto-selection
manager.collect_requirement(global_req)           # Broad scope (will be processed first)
manager.collect_requirement(mss_specific_req)     # MSS-specific

# Allocate all in optimized order
batch_results = manager.allocate_all()
print(f"Successful: {batch_results['successful_allocations']}")
print(f"Total forks: {sum(r['fork_occurred'] for r in batch_results['allocation_details'])}")
```

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. **Scope breadth first**: Process ALL scope before SPECIFIC scope before GROUP scope
2. **Minimize auto-selections early**: Handle explicit values before auto-selections
3. **Size priority**: Larger allocations processed first
4. **Mode preference**: Serial allocations before parallel allocations

### 3. Requirement State Tracking and Fulfillment Details
Each memory requirement tracks its fulfillment state and detailed allocation information:

```python
# Create a requirement
req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=512,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None),  # Auto-select PE
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None), # Auto-select MSS
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),                # All slices
    allocation_id="my_buffer"
)

# Check initial state
print(f"State: {req.state.value}")           # "pending"
print(f"Fulfilled: {req.is_fulfilled()}")    # False

# Allocate
success = manager.allocate_requirement(req)

# Check final state and details
if req.is_fulfilled():
    details = req.allocation_details
    print(f"State: {req.state.value}")                          # "fulfilled"
    print(f"Address: 0x{details.allocated_address:08x}")        # Allocated address
    print(f"Resolved PE: {details.resolved_pe}")                # System-chosen PE
    print(f"Resolved MSS: {details.resolved_mss}")              # System-chosen MSS
    print(f"Slices: {details.resolved_slice_values}")           # Affected slice(s)
    print(f"Mappings: {details.mapping_count_at_allocation}")   # Mapping count at time
```

### 4. Orthogonal Dimension Requirements
Memory requirements can be specified independently across dimensions:

```python
# Uniform allocation across all resources
uniform_req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=4096,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),    # All PEs
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),   # All MSS
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL), # All slices
)

# PE-specific with auto-selected MSS
pe_specific_req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=2048,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=1),    # PE 1 only
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None), # Auto-select MSS
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),               # All slices
)
```

### 5. Smart Resource Selection
The system automatically selects optimal resources based on available space and load balancing:

```python
auto_req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=1024,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None),  # System chooses PE
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None), # System chooses MSS
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),                # All slices
)
```

### 6. Parallel Slice Allocation
Supports parallel allocation across slice groups with automatic distribution:

```python
parallel_req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=2048,  # 512 bytes per slice in group
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.GROUP, group=SliceGroup.GROUP_0_3),
    allocation_mode=SliceAllocationMode.PARALLEL
)
```

## Requirements Summary and Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive tracking of all processed requirements:

```python
# Get summary statistics
summary = manager.get_requirements_summary()
print(f"Total: {summary['total_requirements']}")
print(f"Fulfilled: {summary['fulfilled_count']}")
print(f"Pending: {summary['pending_count']}")

# Print detailed status of all requirements
manager.print_requirements_summary()
```

## Core Classes

### MappingCentricMemoryManager
Main memory manager implementing the multi-dimensional allocation system with these key methods:

- `collect_requirement(req)`: Collect a requirement for later batch allocation
- `allocate_all()`: Allocate all collected requirements in optimal order
- `allocate_requirement(req)`: Immediate allocation of a single requirement
- `get_requirements_summary()`: Get statistics about processed requirements
- `print_requirements_summary()`: Print detailed requirement status

### MemoryRequirement
Represents a memory allocation request with:
- **State tracking**: `RequirementState.PENDING` â†’ `RequirementState.FULFILLED`
- **Allocation details**: Address, resolved dimensions, mapping count
- **Dimension requirements**: Independent specifications for PE, MSS, and slice allocation
- **Allocation mode**: Serial or parallel slice allocation

### AllocationDetails
Contains fulfillment information:
- `allocated_address`: Virtual address where memory was allocated
- `resolved_pe`: Final PE value (for auto-selected or ALL scope)
- `resolved_mss`: Final MSS value (for auto-selected or ALL scope)  
- `resolved_slice_values`: List of affected slice indices
- `mapping_count_at_allocation`: Number of mappings when allocated

### DimensionRequirement
Specifies requirements for a single dimension (PE, MSS, or slice).

## Usage Examples

### Immediate Single Allocation
```python
manager = MappingCentricMemoryManager(pe_count=2, mss_per_pe=4, slices_per_mss=8)

req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=4096,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    allocation_id="kernel_buffer"
)

success = manager.allocate_requirement(req)
if success:
    print(f"Allocated at: 0x{req.allocation_details.allocated_address:08x}")
```

### Batch Allocation with Optimization
```python
manager = MappingCentricMemoryManager(pe_count=2, mss_per_pe=2, slices_per_mss=8)

# Collect requirements in any order
manager.collect_requirement(MemoryRequirement(
    size=512,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=0),  # PE 0 specific
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    allocation_id="pe0_cache"
))

manager.collect_requirement(MemoryRequirement(
    size=1024,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),  # Global (will be processed first)
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    allocation_id="global_data"
))

# System optimizes order and allocates
results = manager.allocate_all()
print(f"Allocated {results['successful_allocations']} requirements")
print(f"Total forks: {sum(r['fork_occurred'] for r in results['allocation_details'])}")
```

### Automatic Resource Selection with Tracking
```python
req = MemoryRequirement(
    size=1024,
    pe_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None),  # Auto-select
    mss_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.SPECIFIC, value=None), # Auto-select
    slice_req=DimensionRequirement(DimensionScope.ALL),
    allocation_id="auto_buffer"
)

success = manager.allocate_requirement(req)
if req.is_fulfilled():
    details = req.allocation_details
    print(f"System chose PE {details.resolved_pe}, MSS {details.resolved_mss}")
    print(f"Allocated at 0x{details.allocated_address:08x}")
```

## Memory Statistics and Monitoring
```python
stats = manager.get_memory_stats()
print(f"Total mappings: {stats['total_mappings']}")
print(f"Total allocated: {sum(m['total_allocated'] for m in stats['mappings']):,} bytes")

# Review all processed requirements
manager.print_requirements_summary()
```
